   <summary>üë®‚Äçüíª About me</summary>

Transitioning from a diverse background in Corporate Events, TV Production and Charity Management, I discovered my passion for programming through self-teaching Python. I was accepted into [Makers](https://makers.tech/), where I completed a rigorous 16-week training covering everything from Python, Engineering Foundations, Databases, Web Applications, Cloud Deployment and Cloud Engineering.

I've since had the opportunity to enhance my skills through various internships:
- **[Marllm.io](https://www.marllm.io/):** Interned as a Web Developer, where I built and deployed web applications.
- **MyWings:** Worked as a Prompt Engineer, developing and training Machine Learning models for the backend of a platform aimed at improving workspace adjustments.

I'm interested in AI, Automation and prompting.
