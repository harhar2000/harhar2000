   <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª My Coding Journey</h3></summary>

Transitioning from a diverse background in Corporate Events, TV Production and Charity Management, I discovered my passion for programming through self-teaching Python. My enthusiasm led me to being accepted into [Makers](https://makers.tech/), where I completed a rigorous 16-week training covering everything from Python, Engineering Foundations, Databases, Web Applications, Cloud Deployment and Cloud Engineering. I've enhanced my skills through several internships, further devloping my abilities in Python and Machine Learning. I am currently developing a text-based terminal game aimed at teaching Python basics to beginners. I'm always eager to tackle more complex problems and evolve my craft.
